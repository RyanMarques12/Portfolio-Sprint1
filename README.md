# Portfolio-Sprint1

In this repository, you will find the files I used to initially create my Personal Portfolio.

I did this by completing various tasks such as adding photos, cleaning up the initial code and stylesheet used as a base, and uploading a downloadable version of my resume. 

Lastly, I added hyperlinks for easy access to my social media accounts, LinkedIn and Github.

# Portfolio-Sprint1

In this repository, you will find the files I used to initially create my Personal Portfolio.

I started by completing various tasks such as adding photos, cleaning up initial code and stylesheet, and uploading a downloadable version of my resume. 

Lastly, I created meta tags to help promote my portfolio through social media.

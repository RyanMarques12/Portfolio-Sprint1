# Portfolio-Sprint1

In this repository, you will find the files I used to initially create my Personal Portfolio.

I did this by completing various tasks such as adding photos, cleaning up the initial code and stylesheet used as a base, and uploading a downloadable version of my resume. 

Lastly, I added hyperlinks for easy access to my social media accounts, LinkedIn and Github.

# What I learned

I learned how to write html code and use css styling to format and populate my own personal portfolio website. 

I learned how to connect a Github Repository with Azure and push local workflows through a static web app.

I learned how to set up a Google Anayltics campaign as well as integrate data collection into my personal portfolio website
